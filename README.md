# Nebula for VS Code

Too many IDE themes focus on attention to ornamentation.
Clean your mind and clean your code with a minimal, colorful, and dark theme.

_Focus on your code, not your editor._

## Meet the colors.

![Six colored dots from red, orange, to green, cyan, blue and indigo](https://cdn.raster.app/nhtzvsqfghtsuw/code-stuff/ThVCpfbjfMT?ixlib=js-3.8.0&s=4f4d861fb8145e3a1531ff953b70a594)

Every great theme starts with great colors.
Five are not enough, sevenâ€” too many.
A family of six, beautiful colors was chosen
through a critical and structured process.

### Multichromatic. Monochromatic.

All colors were tested together in a monochromatic
environment to ensure their contrast levels match so
no single color catches your eye more than the others do.

## ðŸš§ Nebula is a work in progress

Nebula is being built by [TJ Kohli](https://tjkohli.com) and the fine engineering team at [Monogram](https://monogram.io). It was released on August 7th, 2023 and we'll continue making it better. Drop us some feedback in the repo (or better yet â€” make a PR).

Thank you for helping us build a better web together.
